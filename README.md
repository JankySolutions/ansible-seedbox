# Ansible Seedbox
This is an ansible playbook/series of roles to build a seedbox from a clean debian install.


*Note that this is a work in progress and will probably require modification before you can use it*

Copy `config.example.yml` to `config.yml` and edit as needed. Make sure to clone recursively when
you grab the code, several of the roles are submodules.
